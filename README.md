# Detailed About The Application

Quiz Application using Java and Firebase was employed as the backend to store and manage quiz questions, user data, and results. The application
features dynamic quiz content, allowing administrators to easily update and add new questions through the Firebase console. Firebase Authentication ensures
secure user login and registration, enhancing the overall user experience. The combination of Java and Firebase technologies allowed for the development of
a robust, scalable, and easily maintainable Quiz Application, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development for mobile platforms.
